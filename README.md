# living-landscapes
Living Landscapes is an interactive web-based system that transforms spoken or written language into a dynamic, evolving visual landscape in real-time. Rooted in the theme of Landscape Transmission, this project explores the link between language, technology, and biospheresâ€”turning narration into terrain, tone into weather, and words into wildlife.
